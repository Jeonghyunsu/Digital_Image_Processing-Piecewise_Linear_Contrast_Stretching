# Digital_Image_Processing-Piecewise_Linear_Contrast_Stretching

▶ Intensity Transform

* Apply Piecewise-Linear Contrast Stretching to Input Image

  - Input image: lena512.rgb / lena512_420.yuv
  
  - format: BGR / YUV420
  
  - Height = Width = 512

  - (𝑟1, 𝑠1) and (𝑟2, 𝑠2) are applied arbitrarily

  - When the same contrast stretching was applied to different color models, the results were almost identical.
